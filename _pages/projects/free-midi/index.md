# free midi

This is a collection of mp3s generated by
[soundfont2mp3](https://github.com/skratchdot/soundfont2mp3/) and the
[S. Christian Collins GeneralUser GS](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php) Soundfont.

The [timbre.soundfont.js library](https://github.com/skratchdot/timbre.soundfont.js/) uses this
collection of mp3s to play sounds.

It is my hope that a "soundfont url format" is standardized, so that
the timbre.soundfont.js library (and other similar libraries) can make
use of collections of mp3s such as this.

The "soundfont url format" could be similar to the format used by mapping software,
such as the [Web Map Tile Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service) format.

Currently, this repo has 128x128 mp3s included in it (one note for each
instrument in the [general midi standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI#Program_change_events).

You can make requests in the following format:

    http://example.com/channel/0/instrument/{instrument}/{note}.mp3

where {instrument} is a number between 0-127, and {note} is a midi note between 0-127.
