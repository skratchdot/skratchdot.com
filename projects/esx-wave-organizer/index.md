## Info ##

ESX Wave Organizer is a program that allows you to organize, edit, and create .esx files for 
the Korg ESX-1. It uses a standard Windows "drag-and-drop" interface, letting you add .esx, 
.wav, .aif, and .aiff files to the ESX Wave Organizer workspace. It is available for free 
download [here](#download).


## Features ##

- Drag-and-Drop ".esx", ".wav",  ".aif", and ".aiff" files onto the workspace.&nbsp; You can organize the samples how you want by moving them up and down.

- Anytime you drag an ".esx" file onto the workspace, the workspace is cleared, and only that ".esx" file's data is shown.&nbsp; You can then edit and add waves.

- You can extract all the waves from an ".esx" file to the directory of your choice.

- After organizing and editing your samples, you can create a new .esx file with any name you choose.&nbsp; It's pattern and song data comes from the last ".esx" file you loaded.&nbsp; You can clear all the pattern and song data and the sample will data not be affected.

- You can easily view the start, end, loop start, file length, file name, file path, sample rate, sample tune, and stretch step value for each sample.&nbsp; The remaining amount of memory is always visible.

- You can preview the waves you added by clicking the "Play", "Loop", and "Stop" buttons.

- You can load 8 or 16 bit standard PCM .wav files with any sample rate.&nbsp; It will recognize loop data in the same manner as the ESX-1.

- You can load 8 or 16 bit .aif files with any sample rate.

- Drag-and-Drop any type of file into the workspace.&nbsp; If it is not a valid .esx or .wav file, it will be ignored.&nbsp; No annoying pop-ups will alert you!

- Double clicking on a sample in the list will act as pressing the "Play" button, so you can now preview sounds quicker.

- Set all Play Levels with one mouse click.

- The new Pattern Editor allows you to view and edit Pattern Properties.

- You can now view what Patterns each sample is used in.

- You can remove any samples that are not used in a pattern with one mouse click.

- Use the Mono and Stereo Organizers to move and rename multiple samples at once.

- Use the Mono/Stereo Converter to optimize your workspace and save valuable memory space.
