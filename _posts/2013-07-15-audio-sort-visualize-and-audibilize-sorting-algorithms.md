A few weeks ago I saw a [video on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8g-iYGHpEA) that
showed what different sorting algorithms look (and sound) like as they are executing.

Since I've been playing with [timbre.js](http://mohayonao.github.io/timbre.js/) lately,
I started to wonder if I could make a web app to accomplish something similar (using javascript
and [modern web libraries](https://github.com/skratchdot/audio-sort/#built-with)).

I also wanted to attempt to make the audio "sound good".

I came up with something fairly quickly, but then started researching websites that provided
similar functionality.  The more I researched, the more features I wanted to add.  Check
the [long list of links](https://github.com/skratchdot/audio-sort/#see-also--credits)
I researched while working on [Audio Sort](http://projects.skratchdot.com/audio-sort/index.html).

I plan to [add more features](https://github.com/skratchdot/audio-sort/blob/gh-pages/TODO.md)
depending on how bored I get.  Check out [Audio Sort](http://projects.skratchdot.com/audio-sort/index.html)
