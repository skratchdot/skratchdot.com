Thanks to some positive feedback and suggestions, I added these features:

- **Pattern Settings Feature** - Now you can set a starting and ending step, and also
  specify whether or not to loop through the pattern while you hold a key down, or just play the pattern once.

- **Random Generator Addition** - Now you can toggle which effects the random generator can use.

- **Send These Parameters Function** - Now you can select which parameters you want to send to
  the ES-1. If you want to manually tweak knobs on the ES-1, just use this function to deselect the right parameters.
