- No install program in this version. Just unzip it and run it.

- Fixed a minor bug - In old versions, if ES1step could not find a midi input or
  output device, it would still ask you to enter a device number and then quit when
  it couldn't find the device. Now it will tell you to download MidiYOKE and MidiOX.
  ES1step will definately recognize MidiYoke's virtual ports.
