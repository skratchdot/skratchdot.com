A few years ago I saw the great [Tone Matrix](http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/) tool by
[Andre Michelle](http://andre-michelle.com/).  It's a flash based audio experiment that
let's you highlight items in a matrix to create music.

With newer browsers, you are finally able to implement some of the things you could do in
flash years ago, without requiring browser plugins.  I created
[Audio Grid](http://projects.skratchdot.com/audio-grid/index.html) as an experiment to explore
this fact.

It's using [timbre.js](http://mohayonao.github.io/timbre.js/) for it's core functionality, but
is also making use of a few libraries that I recently created for use in
[Audio Sort](/projects/audio-sort/):

- [soundfont2mp3](https://github.com/skratchdot/soundfont2mp3) - a command line utility that lets
  you extract single note mp3s from soundfont files.

- [timbre.soundfont.js](https://github.com/skratchdot/timbre.soundfont.js) - play soundfont urls
  using timbre.js

- [timbre.mp3_decode.js](https://github.com/skratchdot/timbre.mp3_decode.js) - a timbre.js plugin
  that decodes mp3s using jsmad

- [free-midi](https://code.google.com/p/free-midi/) - a collection of mp3s generated by
  [soundfont2mp3](https://github.com/skratchdot/soundfont2mp3) and the
  [S. Christian Collins GeneralUser GS Soundfont](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php). 

You can see a demo of [Audio Grid]() by clicking on the image below:
