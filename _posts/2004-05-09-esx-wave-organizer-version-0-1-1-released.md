You can now simulate pressing the "Play" button by double clicking on a sample in the list.  
Thanks to "Roonan" from Dave Randalls' "Korg-Electribe-SX" Yahoo Forum for suggesting this.  
Also, I fixed a bug which made ESX Wave Organizer ignore .wav files that had a 'smpl' chunk
with the "number of samples" value equal to 0. Thanks to Dmitry for helping find this.
