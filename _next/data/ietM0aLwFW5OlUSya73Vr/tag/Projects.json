Here's a feature list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Added AIFF support. The program will recognize 8 or 16 bit, mono or stereo, .aif files.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added Minimize and Maximize Buttons.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Play and Loop buttons work for every sample now. If you press the Loop button on a\nsample that is not a loop, it will play the whole sample repeatedly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rearranged the main dialog. Now the Mono and Stereo lists are side by side (displaying more samples at once).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Got rid of the \"quick save\" buttons, and added regular \"Windows style\" open and save dialogs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added a \"Remove All Samples\" feature, which deletes all the samples from the workspace, but leaves\nthe pattern and song data that is loaded.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Got rid of the file \"esxwaveorganizer.data\". Now you only need the .exe file for the program to work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Fixed the \"Clear Pattern &amp; Song Data\". Previously, when you cleared all pattern data, each\npart's sample would be set to Mono Sample #000. Now, when you clear all pattern data, and load an\n.esx file into your sampler, each parts' sample will be set to NONE (not Mono Sample #000).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added a Menu with the options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>File:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Open/Add Files To Workspace</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Save As ESX File</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Extract All Waves</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exit</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Clear All Pattern And Song Data</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Pattern Organizer</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Song Organizer</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Remove All Samples</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>About ESX Organizer</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Visit Website</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.3 Released","categories":["Electribe"],"tags":["Electribe","ESX-1","Korg","Projects","Update"],"type":"post","status":"publish"}},{"year":"2004","month":"05","day":"13","slug":"esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-2-released","filename":"2004-05-13-esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-2-released.md","html":"<p>A bug was fixed that would let you add a stereo sample when you shouldn't be\nable to. This would cause the available memory to be negative, which should never\nhappen. Since stereo samples take up twice the memory that mono samples do, I was\nletting you add a stereo sample, without checking if twice it's size would fit. For\nexample, if your memory left was: 4000, and the stereo sample's memory size was 6000,\nit would still be added, because 3000 is less than 4000. Your memory left would be\n-2000 after adding it.
