Most of the methods I was using were very time consuming.</p>\n<p>I decided to script something out so I could easily use the commandline to accomplish this task.</p>\n<p>After some evaluation, I decided to use <a href=\"http://guides.macrumors.com/screencapture\">screencapture</a>\nand <a href=\"http://www.imagemagick.org/\">ImageMagick</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imagemagick.org/\">ImageMagick</a> comes with of few utilities, one of which is\n<a href=\"http://www.imagemagick.org/script/import.php\">import</a>.</p>\n<p>I could have used that tool exclusively (and not used screencapture) if it weren't for the fact\nthat import relies on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System\">X Window System</a> (in\nOSX it's called X11). I wanted something that could take a screenshot without being in an X11\nwindow.</p>\n<p>In the end, I created a shell script called <a href=\"/projects/framecapture/\">framecapture</a>.</p>\n<p>It's a very basic script:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">#!/bin/bash</span>\n\nscreencapture -is <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"<span class=\"hljs-variable\">$1</span>\"</span>\nconvert <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"<span class=\"hljs-variable\">$1</span>\"</span> -mattecolor blue -frame 6x6+2+2 <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"<span class=\"hljs-variable\">$1</span>\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>But I decided to add some error handling, and optional parameters to it.</p>\n<p>You can view it on <a href=\"https://github.com/skratchdot/framecapture/\">Github</a>, or install it by running:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-bash\">sudo curl https://raw.github.com/skratchdot/framecapture/master/framecapture.sh -o /usr/local/bin/framecapture\nsudo <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">chmod</span> +x /usr/local/bin/framecapture\n</code></pre>\n","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"OSX Screenshot With Border From Command Line","published":true,"categories":["OSX","Screenshot","Bash","Shell"],"tags":["OSX","Screenshot","ImageMagick","Bash","Shell","screencapture","framecapture","Projects"]}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
