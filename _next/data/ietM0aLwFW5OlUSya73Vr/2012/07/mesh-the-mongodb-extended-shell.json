Additionally, there's\nsome code so that <strong>\"console\"</strong> calls end up wrapping the built in <strong>print()</strong> function. The idea\nis that eventually I'll add some logic to the console calls so they behave in a more \"standard\" way.</p>\n<p>Another feature is the <strong>mesh.setPrompt()</strong> function. You can pass in a function, or a number 0-4. There\nare a few different types of prompts you can use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0: '&gt;' reset to default prompt</li>\n<li>1: 'dbname&gt;'</li>\n<li>2: 'dbname&gt;' for PRIMARY, '(dbname)&gt;' for SECONDARY</li>\n<li>3: 'host:dbname&gt;'</li>\n<li>4: '[YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss] host:dbname&gt;'</li>\n<li>passing in a function() is the same thing as setting: prompt = myFunction()</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>mesh.setPrompt()</strong> was inspired by the blog post:\n<a href=\"http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2011/06/27/ps1/\">http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2011/06/27/ps1/</a></p>\n<p>Check it out here (and download) here: <a href=\"https://github.com/skratchdot/mesh/\">https://github.com/skratchdot/mesh/</a></p>\n","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"mesh: the MongoDB Extended Shell","published":true,"categories":["MongoDB","Shell"],"tags":["MongoDB","Shell","Shell Extensions","Projects","Update"]}},"previousTitle":"Coldfusion: Convert String To Struct","previousUrl":"/2012/07/coldfusion-convert-string-to-struct","nextTitle":"Can't Install Userscripts in Chrome 21+","nextUrl":"/2012/08/can't-install-userscripts-in-chrome-21+"},"__N_SSG":true}
