Now it will tell you to download MidiYOKE and MidiOX.\nES1step will definately recognize MidiYoke's virtual ports.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"ES-1(step) - Version 0.2.1 Released","categories":["Electribe"],"tags":["Electribe","ES-1","Korg","Projects","Update"],"type":"post","status":"publish"}},"previousTitle":"ES-1(step) - Bug with install fixed","previousUrl":"/2003/08/es-1step-bug-with-install-fixed","nextTitle":"ES-1(step) - Version 1.0.0 Released","nextUrl":"/2003/09/es-1step-version-1-0-0-released"},"__N_SSG":true}
