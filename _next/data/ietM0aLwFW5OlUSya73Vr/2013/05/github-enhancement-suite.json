Since it is starting to be a pain to manage\nso many scripts, and it's even a bigger pain for people if they want to install all of them,\nI've consolidated them all into one script:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/skratchdot/github-enhancement-suite\">The Github Enhancement Suite</a>.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I might make this a legitimate browser extension, and add functionality for turning\nfeatures on and off.
