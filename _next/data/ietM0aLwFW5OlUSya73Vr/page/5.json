Previously, all samples would try to load into slot #000.\nIf that was already in use, it would find the next available slot. Now, you can set the first slot\nnumber to try. It will then find the next available slot (looping around when it gets to the end).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Changed the \"About Box\". Now you can click on my email address to open your default email client\nto email me, or click on the program's webpage url to open your default webbrowser and visit the homepage.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Removed the \"Push Up\" and \"Push Down\" buttons (which weren't implemented), and replaced them with\nthe \"NEVER LOOP\" and \"LOOP WHOLE\" buttons.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The \"NEVER LOOP\" button sets the sample's \"Loop Start\" value equal to the sample's \"End\" value.\nThis means that the sample will never loop when played as a keyboard part.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The \"LOOP WHOLE\" button sets the sample's \"Loop Start\" value equal to the sample's \"Start\" value.\nThis means that the sample will loop completely when played as a keyboard part.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The \"LOOP\" button will only work for MONO samples that have a \"Loop Start\" value. If a sample\ndoesn't have a \"Loop start\" value (and you want to hear it loop), you can press the \"LOOP WHOLE\"\nbutton. Now you can press the \"LOOP\" button.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Changed the \"Extract All Waves\" feature. Before it would rename files with the sample name last.\nNow it renames them with the sample name first. So:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>BEFORE: \"ESXextracted-MONO-140-M1PickBs.wav\"</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>NOW: \"M1PickBs-MONO-140-ESXextracted.wav\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Changed the button name \"Remove The Selected Wave\" to \"Remove The Selected Sample\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Changed the button name \"Edit The Selected Wave\" to \"Edit The Selected Sample\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added a \"Convert Selected Sample (MONO/ST)\" button. This will convert a Mono Sample\nto a Stereo Sample, or a Stereo Sample to a Mono Sample (depending on what is selected,\nand how much free space there is).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>BUGFIX: Before I was only accepting files with the extensions (.esx, .wav, and .aif).\nI was ignoring all other files (including .aiff). Now I am accepting .aiff as well as\n.aif, so: (.esx, .wav, .aif, and .aiff are all the acceptable formats). Thanks to Jayzilla for reporting this.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added a \"Pattern List\" Column in the Sample Organizers, which let you see what Patterns a\nSample is used in.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added a \"Remove All Samples Not Used In A Pattern\" function. This lets you free up space by\nremoving any samples that aren't being used.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added a \"Mono Organizer\" function. This opens up a new dialog window, which will let you select\nmultiple samples, and move them around (by dragging them). Hold down the shift button to select\nmultiple samples. You can rename multiple samples, and change their stretch step values. If you\ncheck the \"Add Number\" box, then you can rename multiple samples, and a unique number will be added\nto the end of the sample name (for instance: if you type \"bass\", your samples will be renamed \"bass0\",\n\"bass1\", \"bass2\", etc.).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.7 Released","categories":["Electribe"],"tags":["Electribe","ESX-1","Korg","Projects","Update"],"type":"post","status":"publish"}},{"year":"2005","month":"06","day":"17","slug":"esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-6-released","filename":"2005-06-17-esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-6-released.md","html":"<ul>\n<li><p>Fixed major \"SLICE\" problem.

Previously, I was also making sure that it had the value \"BPS\" in one place.\nThis was not needed, and it was not true for all .esx files. I found this out because someone emailed me\nsaying that the program was not accepting their .esx file. Where I thought that the value \"BPS\" was needed,\nit wasn't. The .esx file in question, had the value \"BPA\" where I thought the value had to be \"BPS\". If\nanyone else has a problem loading an .esx file into the workspace, email me...
