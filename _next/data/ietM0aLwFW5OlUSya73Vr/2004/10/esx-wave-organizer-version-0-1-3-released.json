Here's a feature list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Added AIFF support. The program will recognize 8 or 16 bit, mono or stereo, .aif files.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added Minimize and Maximize Buttons.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Play and Loop buttons work for every sample now. If you press the Loop button on a\nsample that is not a loop, it will play the whole sample repeatedly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rearranged the main dialog. Now the Mono and Stereo lists are side by side (displaying more samples at once).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Got rid of the \"quick save\" buttons, and added regular \"Windows style\" open and save dialogs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added a \"Remove All Samples\" feature, which deletes all the samples from the workspace, but leaves\nthe pattern and song data that is loaded.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Got rid of the file \"esxwaveorganizer.data\". Now you only need the .exe file for the program to work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Fixed the \"Clear Pattern &amp; Song Data\". Previously, when you cleared all pattern data, each\npart's sample would be set to Mono Sample #000. Now, when you clear all pattern data, and load an\n.esx file into your sampler, each parts' sample will be set to NONE (not Mono Sample #000).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added a Menu with the options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>File:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Open/Add Files To Workspace</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Save As ESX File</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Extract All Waves</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Exit</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Clear All Pattern And Song Data</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Pattern Organizer</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Song Organizer</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Remove All Samples</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>About ESX Organizer</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Visit Website</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.3 Released","categories":["Electribe"],"tags":["Electribe","ESX-1","Korg","Projects","Update"],"type":"post","status":"publish"}},"previousTitle":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.2 Released","previousUrl":"/2004/05/esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-2-released","nextTitle":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.4 Released","nextUrl":"/2004/11/esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-4-released"},"__N_SSG":true}
