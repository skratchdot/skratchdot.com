This has been fixed. No matter what sample you click on,\nit will always become the focus...</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>BUG FIX == Before I accept an .esx file into the workspace, I do a few checks on the file. It must\ncontain the values \"KORG\" in 2 places; it must contain the value 0x71 in two places; and it must contain\nthe value \"ESX\" in one place. Previously, I was also making sure that it had the value \"BPS\" in one place.\nThis was not needed, and it was not true for all .esx files. I found this out because someone emailed me\nsaying that the program was not accepting their .esx file. Where I thought that the value \"BPS\" was needed,\nit wasn't. The .esx file in question, had the value \"BPA\" where I thought the value had to be \"BPS\". If\nanyone else has a problem loading an .esx file into the workspace, email me... It is probably because one of\nthe other checks I do is unnecessary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.4 Released","categories":["Electribe"],"tags":["Electribe","ESX-1","Korg","Projects","Update"],"type":"post","status":"publish"}},"previousTitle":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.3 Released","previousUrl":"/2004/10/esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-3-released","nextTitle":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.5 BETA","nextUrl":"/2004/12/esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-5-beta"},"__N_SSG":true}
