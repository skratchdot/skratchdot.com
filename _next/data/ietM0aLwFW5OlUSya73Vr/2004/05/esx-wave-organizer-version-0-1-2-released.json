This would cause the available memory to be negative, which should never\nhappen. Since stereo samples take up twice the memory that mono samples do, I was\nletting you add a stereo sample, without checking if twice it's size would fit. For\nexample, if your memory left was: 4000, and the stereo sample's memory size was 6000,\nit would still be added, because 3000 is less than 4000. Your memory left would be\n-2000 after adding it. All this has been fixed, and hopefully no one ran into the problem...</p>\n","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.2 Released","categories":["Electribe"],"tags":["Electribe","ESX-1","Korg","Projects","Update"],"type":"post","status":"publish"}},"previousTitle":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.1 Released","previousUrl":"/2004/05/esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-1-released","nextTitle":"ESX Wave Organizer - Version 0.1.3 Released","nextUrl":"/2004/10/esx-wave-organizer-version-0-1-3-released"},"__N_SSG":true}
